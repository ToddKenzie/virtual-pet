#	Virtual Pet Project

**WeCanCodeIt Module 2 Project**

##	Objectives

Create a virtual pet with multiple attributes.  Main method will cause a tick() rate to calculate the amount of time that has passed, and likely change attributes of the pet.  User will be able to interact with the pet during the process, also modifying attributes with those interactions.

###	Attributes for the virtual pet

Attributes will have various ratings.  Rating of 0 means perfectly fine, whereas a high rating will indicate an issue.  Too high of a rating will cause potential misbehaviors with the pet, or even leaving the user / death.
